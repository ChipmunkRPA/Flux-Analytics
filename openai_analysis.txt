Here's a clear, detailed explanation and analysis of the key month-over-month (MoM) and quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) fluctuations, along with underlying drivers and likely causes, based on your summary tables and transaction breakdowns.

## 1. Overview of Monthly and Quarterly Trends

### Major Movements (MoM and QoQ)

- **2025-02 to 2025-03:**  
  Massive drop (-$4.25M, -98%)  
  Driven by reversal of large February accruals and end of big event period.
- **2025-03 to 2025-04:**  
  Additional decrease (~$493K, -599%)  
  Ongoing reversals of March accruals, but some reappearance of event costs.
- **2025-04 to 2025-05:**  
  Large increase (+$1.94M, -472% MoM, though actual sign is positive to less negative)  
  Driven by the reversal of prior negative accruals and recognition of "real" expenses post-event.
- **2025-05 to 2025-06:**  
  Sharp drop (-$1.5M, -98.5%)  
  Event costs and large accruals drop out; regular expense run-rate resumes.
- **2025-06 to 2025-07:**  
  Increase ($148K, +665%)  
  Accruals for upcoming events appear; normal monthly pattern resumes.
- **2025-07 to 2025-08:**  
  Drop ($89K, -53%)  
  Some accrual reversals and event expense wind-down.
- **2025-08 to 2025-09:**  
  Further drop ($86K, -107%)  
  Small accrual reversals and closeout of event- or project-related spending.

- **Quarterly:**  
  Q1 very high ($4M), Q2 drops sharply (-57% to $1.7M), Q3 collapses (-95% to $75K).  
  Major drivers are event timing and accrual accounting (see below).

## 2. Main Drivers and Typical Causes

### Key Pattern: Event-Driven Accruals and Reversals
Through your data, the dominant narrative is the impact of **Sales Kickoff (SKO) and President’s Club events**, and how large AP accruals are booked and reversed when actual invoices arrive and events occur.

#### a) February–March (Transition)
- **February 2025**:  
  - High expense total driven almost entirely by accruals for open POs and anticipated event costs:
    - e.g., “AP Accrual - February 2025 Open PO accruals 11118-1”, “15083-1”, Amortization Destination.
  - No actual cash/procurement outflow yet; expenses accrued for the upcoming event.

- **March 2025:**  
  - Massive reversal of the above accruals as the event concludes and actuals come due.
    - February accrual memos appear as large negatives, offsetting prior positive accruals.
    - New (March) accruals are booked for outstanding March obligations.
    - "Amortization Destination" also drops sharply, reflecting less straight-line expense in March.
    - March sees some new event-related costs (EDP Service Agreement, swag, video, etc.), but much lower than February's accrual bulk.

  **Main cause:**  
  - Accrual methodology: Book entire anticipated event costs as liabilities (accruals) before the event, then reverse as invoices are settled. The spike in February is reversed as invoices are matched (hence negative swings in March).
  - Large, lumpy event timing causes abnormal volatility.

#### b) March–April
- Repetition of the same pattern for March accruals:
  - March accruals are reversed out (appear as negatives).
  - Some event actuals (Sales Kickoff, AV balances) hit as real expenses (new positive memos).
- New costs for ongoing event wrap-up, awards, and other settlements.

#### c) April–May
- As the event period passes, reversals of remaining accruals dominate, and new expense flows (such as President's Club charges, fresh manual accrual estimates) come in.
- Amortization picks up (straight-line recognition of some prepaid expenses).
- Large event-related costs are absent after this month; expense run-rate stabilizes.

#### d) May–June and beyond
- Only "business as usual" accrual and event wind-downs remain.
- New accruals are smaller and tied to routine operations or upcoming, far smaller events (June/July accruals, Black Hat USA participation, etc.).
- Amortization continues but at much lower dollar value, as large prepaid assets are mostly expensed.

## 3. Illustrative Examples & Specific Memos

### Largest Fluctuations Tied to Accruals for Events:
- **AP Accrual memos** (e.g., "11118-1", "15083-1") are booked, reversed, reborn for each relevant month.
- **SKO/President’s Club** memo appearances line up with event windows, large swings in expense, and reversal of prior month counterparts.

### Big Downswings Explained:
- When events complete, and previously accrued costs are recognized, like so:
   - February accrual booked (+)
   - March reversal after event as actuals posted (-)
   - April real costs recognized (some reversed accruals, some new expenses)

### Amortization Swings:
- Early months (Feb/Mar/Apr) have higher Amortization Destination lines, as prepayments (possibly software or venue costs) are expensed more heavily.
- Drops off post-event, matching declining balance sheet prepaids.

## 4. Key Point Summary Table

| Month/Quarter    | Trend               | Main Reason/Driver                                |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 2025-02 to 2025-03 | Huge decrease (-98%) | Reversal of event accruals, handoff from accrued to actual expense, event ends |
| 2025-03 to 2025-04 | Further decrease    | More reversal of accruals, event wrap-up          |
| 2025-04 to 2025-05 | Upward swing        | Reversal of prior negative accruals; real event expenses recognized, new accruals booked for next cycle |
| 2025-05 to 2025-06 | Down again (-98.5%) | Event costs finished; business-as-usual resumes   |
| Q1 → Q2           | Down (-57%)         | Event over; no more major accruals/actuals        |
| Q2 → Q3           | Down (-96%)         | Routine, no event accruals, just residual or closing costs |

## 5. Likely Causes (Summarized)

- **Accrual Accounting Effect:**  
  - Large accruals for major events inflate monthly totals before the events.
  - Matching reversals in subsequent months produce dramatic downswings.
- **Event Seasonality:**  
  - Big swings coincide with the timing of annual events (SKO, President’s Club), driving most volatility.
- **Amortization Patterns:**  
  - Upfront prepayments for venues/services are spread across months; starts high, drops as events conclude.
- **Normalization Post-Event:**  
  - After May, months revert to a much lower, "normal" expense rate with only ongoing run-rate items.

## 6. In Plain English

Most of the wild fluctuations in monthly (and, thus, quarterly) numbers are purely the result of timing: when big events are planned, accruals are booked in advance, then reversed or replaced by actuals when the event happens and vendors are paid. After the major event season, the numbers drop dramatically, because there are no more major events and the related accrual reversals have already "washed out" the earlier increases.

In short:

> **90%+ of the volatility is about the accounting for large annual events. You see high numbers when accruals are made, giant negative swings as they reverse, and finally a stable run-rate once the events and their accounting cycles finish.**
